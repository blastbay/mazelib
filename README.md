# Introduction
This is a single file, cross platform, public domain C library which generates mazes using the so called growing tree algorithm.
The algorithm is highly configurable and generates nice mazes of varying styles.


The library generates mazes portably across platforms and C standard library implementations.
It comes bundled with a fast, high quality pseudo random number generator called xoshiro256++.
This ensures that given the same seed and configuration settings, the exact same maze will always be generated.


The library has no global state, which means it can be used safely across multiple threads with a modicum of care.


The library does not allocate any dynamic memory.


# Features
mazelib has the following notable features:
* Easy to integrate (the library is stored in a single file).
* Generates mazes in a reproducible fashion across platforms
* No dynamic memory allocations
* High level API which is easy to use out of the box
* Lower level API which gives maximum flexibility and control
* Generates mazes in two formats (compact and blockwise)
* Portable ANSI C89 code with no external dependencies.
* Easy to customize and configure
* No licensing restrictions (public domain or MIT licensed with no attribution requirements).

# Algorithm Description
The algorithm is flexible, but quite simple. Here's an overview:
1. Start with an empty list, and add a random cell to it.
2. While the list is not empty, select a cell from it.
3. Select an unvisited neighboring cell at random, and add it to the end of the list.
4. Carve a two way passage between the cell and the chosen neighbor, and mark both cells as visited.
5. If there are no unvisited neighbors in step 3, remove the cell from the list.
6. Return to step 2.


The part that makes this algorithm especially interesting is how cells are chosen from the list in step 2.
If you always choose the cell at the end of the list, you get a maze with a very high river factor (AKA long passages with few dead ends).
If you instead choose a cell at random, you get a maze with a very low river factor (AKA short passages with many dead ends).
You can also do something in between, such as selecting the last cell in the list 50% of the time and a random one the other 50%.

The library was inspired by two blog posts by Jamis Buck.

The library ships with a fast, high quality pseudo random number generator called xoshiro256++, as well as another generator called splitmix64 which is used for seeding from a 64 bit integer.
Both of these algorithms are in the public domain.
